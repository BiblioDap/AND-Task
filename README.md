# AND-Task

This dataset consists of two parts: Devlopement.csv and Testing.csv.

Authors may use the developement part to design their model and they may split it (i.e. Training, validation and testing sets) in anyway they find appropriate. The Testing part will be split such that each target author is present in all sets: Training, validation and testing. If the target author did not publish enough papers to fulfill this condition, the priority is in this order: training, then validation then testing. This means if an author has authored only 2 papers, one will be in the training set and the other in the validation set. In the testing part, the labels will be provided for the training and testing parts only.
